# Blood Donor Connect

A life-saving platform built to connect blood donors with patients in need, especially in emergency situations. Inspired by real hospital experiences where many patients struggled due to a lack of immediate donor contact — not because donors didn't exist, but because there was no way to reach them.

## 💡 Motivation

> "My name is **Shankar Kalyankar**.  
> I've seen many people in super specialty hospitals struggling during blood emergencies.  
> This website is my small attempt to help.  
> In our college itself, we have many willing donors — the real problem is **approach**.  
> If this site helps even one person, it will be worth it."
